# Mendeleev
💡 What is the Mendeleev Project?
Inspired by the periodic table, this project leverages data science techniques to analyze standard electrochemical potentials across all elements. 

My goal is to uncover hidden patterns, gain new insights, and contribute to the scientific understanding of elemental properties.
  
🔍 Key objectives:
Visualize well-known periodic trends (like atomic radius and electronegativity) in fresh, informative ways.
Discover potential hidden correlations within electrochemical data.
Offer a new perspective on the fundamental properties of elements.
